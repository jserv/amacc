# How IR work inside AMaCC

## What is an IR? 
An IR is a representation of a "program" between source code and target languages.Before
creating binary,the compiler frontend will generate IR to help compiler backend to
generate binary file that is independent of the source.

## Why use an IR?
* Because translation appears to inherently require analysis and synthesis.
* Break the difficult problem of translation into two simpler,more manageable pieces.
* To build retargetable compilers:
    * Build new back ends for an existing front end(make source language more portable and
      across machine).
    * Can build a new front-end for an existing back end.
    * We only have to write 2n half-compilers instead of n(n-1) full compilers.
    * To perform machine independent optimizations.

So how does the IR actually work? Let's have an example:
```c
int a;
a = 10 + 1 + 11;
```
Inside AMaCCï¼Œthe source code will be converted into following IR:
```
IMM  10
PSH 
IMM  1
ADD 
PSH 
IMM  11
ADD 
```
These IR will be stored inside the stack.According to the stack execution mode LIFO (Last in First Out), these instructions will be executed sequentially from top to bottom by push and pop.
```
| IMM  10 | pop `IMM 10`
| PSH     |-------------> | PSH   | pop `PSH`
| IMM  1  |               | IMM 1 |-------------> | IMM 1 | pop `IMM 1`
| ADD     |               | ADD   |               | ADD   |------------->
| PSH     |               | PSH   |               | PSH   |
| IMM  11 |               | IMM 11|               | IMM 11|
| ADD     |               | ADD   |               | ADD   |

stack                   
|         |               |       |               |   10  |
reg
|         |               |   10  |               |       |
```
```
|  ADD    |  pop `ADD`
|  PSH    |-------------> | PSH   |  pop `PSH`
|  IMM 11 |               | IMM 11|-------------> | IMM 11|
|  ADD    |               | ADD   |               | ADD   |
stack                   
|   10    |               |       |               |   11  |
reg
|   1     |               |   11  |               |       |
```
```
|  IMM 11 |  pop `IMM 11`               pop `ADD`
|  ADD    | ----------->  | ADD   |  -----------> |       |
stack                   
|   11    |               |   11  |               |       |
reg
|         |               |   11  |               |   22  | --------> Now we get the result!

## Take a look how function call inside AMaCC

```c
int func(int a)
{
    return a * 10;
}

int main()
{
    func(20);
    return 0;
}
```

compiled with AMaCC,passing argument `-s`
```c
1: int func(int a)
2: {
3:     return a * 10;
    ENT  0          ; save func addres on stack
    LEA  2          ; fetch a's address on stack and save into general register
    LI              ; Load integer from memory which address is inside general register
    PSH             ; push interger to top of stack which is inside general register
    IMM  10         ; move 10 into general register
    MUL             ; pop 'a' on the top of stack,and multiply 10 which is inside general register,store result into general register
    LEV             ; return to main
4: }
    LEV             ; do nothing
5:
6: int main()
7: {
8:     func(20);
    ENT  0          ; save main address on stack
    IMM  20         ; move 20 into general register
    PSH             ; push r0 on top of stack
    JSR  -11120300  ; save sp on stack,save current execute position to lr,jump to func
    ADJ  1          ; remove 20 from stack
9:     return 0;
    IMM  0          ; move 0 into general register
    LEV             ; return to entry
10: }
    LEV             ; do nothing
```

# Arithmetic instructions

Each operator has two arguments, the first one is store on the top of the stack,the second is stored in general register.After the calculation is done, the argument on the stack will be poped out and the result will be stored in general register. So you are not able to fetch the first argument from the stack after the calculation.

You can see the above example to know how arithmetic instructions work.

# compare instructions

The `BZ` and `BNZ` instructions must be used with arithmetic instructions,such as `EQ`,`NE`,`LT`,`GT`,`LE` and `GE`.

example

```c
7:     if (n > 0) {
    LEA  2          ; fetch n's address
    LI              ; load n's value into r0 register
    PSH             ; push n on to stack
    IMM  0          ; move 0 into r0 register
    GT              ; compare r0 and r1(pop r1 first on top of stack)
    BZ   0          ; jump when r1>r0
```
The arithmetic instructions for compare will be translated to ARM instruction,for exampe:
```
# GT
pop  {r1}
cmp  r1, r0
movgt r0, 1
movle r0, 0
```
and the branch instructions can be work as:
```
# BZ
cmp  r0, 0
beq  0xff4a31d4
```
|   opcode     | format      |      ARM instructions        | comments |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
| BZ           | BZ <value>  |cmp  r0, 0;beq  \<address\>   |branch on zero
| BNZ          | BNZ <value> |cmp  r0, 0;bne  \<address\>   |branch on not zero
