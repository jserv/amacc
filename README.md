# AMaCC = Arguably Minimalist Arm C Compiler

## Introduction
AMaCC is built from scratch, targeted at 32-bit Arm architecture.
It is a stripped down version of C meant as a pedagogical tool for
learning about compilers, linkers, and loaders.

There are 2 execution modes AMaCC implements:
* Just-in-Time compiler (JITC) for Arm backend
* Generate valid GNU/Linux executables with Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)

It is worth mentioning that AMaCC is designed to compile a subset of C
required to self-host with the above execution modes. For example,
global variables and, in particular, global arrays are there.

A simple stack based AST is generated through cooperating `stmt()` and `expr()`
parsing functions, both of which are fed by a token generating function.
The `expr()` function does some literal constant optimizations. The AST is
transformed into a stack-based VM Intermediate Representation via a `gen()`
function.  The IR can be examined through a command-line option.  Finally,
a `codegen()` function is used to generate ARM32 instructions from the IR
which can be executed via either `jit()` or `elf32()` executable generation.

AMACC mixes classical recursive descent and operator precedence parsing.
An operator precedence parser is actually quite a bit faster than
recursive descent parser (RDP) for expressions when operator precedence
is defined using grammar productions that would otherwise get turned
into methods.

## Compatibility
AMaCC is capable of compiling C source files written in the following
syntax:

* support for all C89 statements except typedef.
* support for all C89 expression operators.
* data types: char, int, enum, struct, union, and multi-level pointers
    - type modifiers, qualifiers, and storage class specifiers are
      currently unsupported, though many keywords of this nature
      are not routinely used, and can be easily worked around with
      simple alternative constructs.
* global/local variable initializations for supported data types
    - e.g., `int i = [expr]`
    - New variables are allowed to be declared within functions anywhere.
    - item-by-item array initialization is supported
    - but aggregate array declaration and initialization is yet to be supported
      e.g., `int foo[2][2] = { { 1, 0 }, { 0, 1 } };`

The architecture support targets armv7hf with Linux ABI, verified on
Raspberry Pi 2/3/4 with GNU/Linux.

## Prerequisites
* Code generator in AMaCC relies on several GNU/Linux behaviors, and it
  is necessary to have Arm/Linux installed in your build environment.
* Install [GNU Toolchain for the A-profile Architecture](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-a/downloads)
    - Select `arm-linux-none-gnueabihf` (AArch32 target with hard float)

* Install QEMU for Arm user emulation
```shell
sudo apt-get install qemu-user
```

## Running AMaCC
Run `make check` and you should see this:
```
[ C to IR translation          ] Passed
[ JIT compilation + execution  ] Passed
[ ELF generation               ] Passed
[ nested/self compilation      ] Passed
[ Compatibility with GCC/Arm   ] ........................................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 52 tests in 8.842s

OK
```

Check the messages generated by `make help` to learn more.

## Benchmark
AMaCC is able to generate machine code really fast and provides 70% of the performance of `gcc -O0`.

Test environment:
* Raspberry Pi 4B (SoC: bcm2711, ARMv8-A architecture)
* Raspbian GNU/Linux, kernel 5.10.17-v7l+, gcc 8.3.0 (armv7l userland)
